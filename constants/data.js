    description: [
      `I am a passionate Frontend Engineer with over 3 years of experience, specializing in responsive React-based web applications.`,
      `I’ve been working as a frontend engineer at Snail Team Six Software Development Corp. for almost 2 years, and now seeking a new challenge. I think my experience and skills in React make me perfect for any Frontend Engineering role.`,
      `I’ve worked in both large development teams and fast-paced start-up environments that have sharpened my technical skills improved my communication and made me understand what it takes to meet very tight deadlines.`,
      `I’m hands-on in all stages of the software development cycle, from planning and design to testing and deployment. No two days are the same for me; my tasks may involve developing features, altering code, fixing bugs, brainstorming ideas, or integrating new systems.`,
      `Something that I love about front-end engineering is the opportunity to develop what the end user will actually see with a great user experience. The software development lifecycle involves working with so many different people and departments and, as a people person and someone who loves to build new relationships, it’s great to be able to come together with other professionals who are striving towards the same goal.`
